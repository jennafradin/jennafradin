### Hi there ! ðŸ‘‹

I am Jenna Fradin, a Neurosciences graduate from [The University of Paul Sabatier](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/). I am currently working as an engineer at the [ISIR lab](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/) in Paris. 

I am particularly interested in sensory signal processing by the cortex: How the human brain integrates raw sensory signals to construct its view of the world. I am always happy to discuss about this topic and other topic related to Neurosciences. Feel free to connect with me here:
